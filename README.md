## What is Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation through agentless, declarative playbooks written in YAML.


## What is Cloudformation

AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables users to define and provision AWS infrastructure as code (IaC) using declarative templates, allowing for automated and repeatable provisioning of resources.

## Objective

We will be using Cloudformation and Ansible to create and configure our Cloud Environment.
